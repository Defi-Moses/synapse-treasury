Repository Management:
- Ideally would merge with Synapse Treasury Frontend
    - link the data so that one doesnt need to copy and paste
- Historical Data needs to be updated with new contracts and newly supported chains
    - Need to add monthly blocktimestamps for base, harmony, klaytn
    - Run backfill_treasury_balances()
- Could have something that updates daily  (would have to setup a server)
